      <p class="flavor">Cuddly Panda bears who will punch your face.</p>
      <p>Chian was sitting on his favorite rock close to the village. It was his favorite because he could look all the way over the jungle from there. He opened his eyes wide from surprise when suddenly a butterfly landed on his nose. Trying to sit as still as possible to make sure the butterfly wouldn't fly away, he didn't notice he was slightly leaning to the left. After a second or two he lost his balance, making him tumble all the way down the hill...</p>
      <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <p>Pandafolk are beasts capable of standing bipedally. Their bodies are covered in a pattern of black and white fur. Their face is iconically white with round black ears and black circles around their eyes. Unlike the typical panda, they have fully prehensile paws with an opposing thumb. Portions of their fur can also grow longer to make things like whiskers and beards.</p>
      <h4>HISTORY</h4>
      <p>The pandafolk are a peaceful race dwelling amongst the bamboo forests on mountains enshrouded by golden mists. They were originally nomadic, travelling as the groves of bamboo rose and fell. However, with the wisdom endowed to them by the dragon spirit, they learned to cultivate their own crop and so settled in fertile valleys. However, they were ill-prepared for the ills which would befall them. Being docile and a bit roly-poly, they were ill-equipped to face predators and other threats which would often come and raze their settlements. The dragon spirit heard their grief and sent five envoys: a turtle, a fox, a yeti, a jaguar, and a serpent. These envoys would draw the divisions of the pandafolk race to train in their own art, scattering the race in five directions. They would live to survive and develop new skills under the guidance of their given patron. When the time was right, they would return to take back the land they deserved.</p>
      <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
      <p>Pandafolk are herbivores. They thus must live in areas liveable for plants on a large scale. They were originally nomads, dependant on the growth of bamboo in predictable cycles and locations. However, this often put them at the mercy of freak weather and deforestation. Thus, with the guidance of the great dragon spirit, they came to learn farming and grew their own bamboo. Their current society is currently split into five clans, each under their respective patron envoy sent by the dragon spirit. They have set up small villages led by elders, where they spend most of their days training their mind and spirit in accordance with the envoy's ways.</p>
      <h4>PERSONALITY</h4>
      <p>Pandafolk can be fastidious about their training, but are generally laid-back. They enjoy slow meals where they can forget about hardship and problems, preferring to spend time socializing with others. People usually note them to be a bit food-driven and lazy. However, they can be dedicated to something they have a passion for, and never lose their sense of humor. They value friendship and relationships greatly, and are always willing to help a comrade in need. To some pandafolk, friends are as simple as those willing to break bread with them.</p>
      <h4>RELIGION</h4>
      <p>The great dragon spirit is not a real central deity to the pandafolk. They do not follow a religion revolving around gods, but rather around spirits of animals and nature. However, it is simply sometimes translated to "god" in Common, rather than the pandafolk concept for it, for which there is no equivalent. They do frequent exercises meant to channel their chi, which is the energy they believe to run through all of life. It is the essence of all things, and when one dies, it will carry on to be joined in the great chi well that is the afterlife, to be made into new life.</p>
