    <description>
      <p> Avast, matey, and lend here yer ears. Pirates are lords and ladies of the skies and sea, simultaneously capable fighters, noble wanderers, and plucky socialites. At home away from land, pirates care more for the cool breeze of the sea or thunder of cloud cover than a busy street or quiet farmstead. </p>
      <p class="indent"> Pirates are imbued with magic that lets them navigate the world via boat or airship. As veritable jacks and jills of all trades, no two pirates are alike. Some are dashing buccaneers as quick with wit as they are the tip of their rapier. Others are salty dogs whose sneer could frighten barnacles off the belly of a whale. </p>

        <li> Because of your excellent tactics, the AC of your ships increases by +1 when you are at the command. This bonus increases by an additional +1 when you reach 5th level (+2), and again at 11th level (+3), and 17th level (+4). Your ship also has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects of which you are aware. </li>
        <li> For any waterborne or airborne vehicle that you are the captain of with a crew of 10 or more (before your modifier), the hit points of the vehicle increase by an amount equal to 10 times your levels in this class. In addition, its speed increases by 2 mph. </li>

    <description>
      <p> You have learned to use the magical essence of the sea or sky to cast spells, much as a ranger does. See the Fifth Edition core rulebook for the general rules of spellcasting and this page for the pirate spell list. </p>
      <h5 class="caption">Cantrips</h5>
      <p> You know two cantrips of your choice from the pirate spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional pirate cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Pirate table. </p>
      <p class="indent"> When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the pirate cantrips you know with another cantrip from the pirate spell list. </p>
      <h5 class="caption">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>
      <p> The Pirate table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your pirate spells. To cast one of your pirate spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </p>
      <p class="indent"> You prepare the list of pirate spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the pirate spell list. When you do so, choose a number of pirate spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your pirate level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </p>
      <p class="indent"> For example, if you are a 5th-level pirate, you have four 1stlevel and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2ndlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. </p>
      <p class="indent"> You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of pirate spells requires time spent focusing on nature and your current environment: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
      <p> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your pirate spells since your magic draws on your overall force of will. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a pirate spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </p>
      <center>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Immediately after you take the Attack action against a creature with a melee weapon on your turn, you can expend one use of your Pirate's Luck to use your bonus action to beguile the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures immune to charm automatically succeed on their saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target has disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. </p>

However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. </p>
