		<description>
			<p>Hadozee, the so called "deck apes", are a hard-working spacefaring race known for their salty language, able warriors, but otherwise peaceful outlook. Spacers to the core, most hadozee encountered away from their homeworld have never been to their ancestral home. They've taken up the role of sailors and mercenaries through the endless sea of space on many a ship.</p>
			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>The hadozee, are tall hairy humanoids with simian faces, a shaggy mane and a stooped posture. Their hair is usually orange or brown among other dark colors. The mouth of a hadozee is a protruding muzzle with several long fangs. They have lean muscles and patagium – a parachute-like membranes that stretch from wrist to ankle – that allows them to glide short distances. They are also very nimble, able to climb trees, ropes, and other surfaces with ease. In short, one may say they resemble apes that have some flight ability.</p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>The hadozee homeworld is in a small sphere at the edge of known space. It is a subtropical world consisting of high mesas, and deep jungle canyons; the ideal environment for their gliding ability. Though they prefer warm weather, they can dress for colder climes. They are said to live there like monkeys in a rainforest. However, a diaspora occurred some eons ago, scattering much of the race. Thus, hadozee were no longer exclusive to their unnamed home world. They could be encountered in many places within the reaches of space.</p>
			<h4>Society</h4>
			<p>Groups of hadozee form troops. They often tried to survive wherever their diaspora landed them, however they could. Those who landed on Prime would come to be good friends with elves, for whom they would fight in some wars. Hadozee generally are not warmongers, but they are capable of great strength and savagery in battle. The chieftain of the troop is said to have the most power, and thereby deter the other hadozees from violence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hadozee sometimes have wanderlust. Many who are born off their home resulting from the diaspora are curious of the stars. They will usually try to find ways to get on a spaceship crew. If that fails, they may resort to stowing away. Regardless, hadozee are an iconic part of many ship crews. They are typically hard-working and prioritized. Usually, they despise work, especially grunt duty, as they prefer to be free flying around the cabin.</p>
