    <description>
      <p>The Oath of Love drives a paladin to protect and care for people dear to their hearts. Some falsely believe that this only applies to romantic love, and imagine valiant knights pursuing ravishing beauties whom they have become smitten by. But love is not limited to romance or attraction, and many dedicate themselves in the service of their hearts. A father who adores his children may be driven to become a paladin to protect them, a friend may swear an oath of love to aid their best friend on a perilous journey, others may even swear this oath to spread the message of love to others, to bring strangers together in tenderness. Of course, there are still those whose souls are bound together in romance and true love may spark one or both to swear these bonds of trust and protection to each other. Paladins who follow this oath might adorn themselves with traditional symbols of love such as hearts and flowers, but others may choose emblems that are suited to the individuals they seek to watch over.</p>
      <h5>TENETS OF LOVE</h5>
      <p>The tenets of the Oath of Love may vary depending on the nature of the chosen paladin but often they share these similar core ideals.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Love is Unconditional.</em>
        </strong> Love and care for others sincerely without limitation or exception.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Protect their Freedoms.</em>
        </strong> Watch over your loved ones with care, but let them walk their own path.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Share their Burdens.</em>
        </strong> Help those you love with their hardships and support them in their ambitions.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Love Yourself.</em>
        </strong> Believe you are just as deserving of love as those to whom you give it.

      <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Awoken Heart.</em>
        </strong> As a bonus action, you can speak a phrase or perform a gesture that transforms you into an avatar of love and protection using your Channel Divinity. This transformation lasts 1 minute, until you are incapacitated or until you choose to end it as part of any other action. Whilst transformed in this manner you gain the following benefits.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your appearance changes in subtle ways. You can appear shorter, taller, thinner, fatter or more muscular. Your skin, hair and eyes can change colour and any equipment you are carrying or wearing can appear different, though it's properties do not change. You can't use this ability to appear as a specific person or creature.</li>
        <li>You create a harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of rose petals, faint ethereal music, or a pleasant scent around you for the duration of the transformation. </li>
        <li>When you take the Attack action, you may choose to make one of your attacks a ranged spell attack instead. You are considered proficient with it, and you add your Charisma modifier to its attack and damage rolls. The attack has a range of 60 feet and deals radiant damage instead of the weapons normal type. In addition, you may use any paladin class feature or spell that works with melee weapon attacks, such as Divine Smite, with this special attack.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Empathic Guidance.</em>
        </strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to open yourself to the emotions of others. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks for the next 10 minutes.

When a creature you can see within 60 feet of  you is the target of an attack or effect that requires a Dexterity saving throw, you can use  your reaction to magically teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the triggering creature and grant them a bonus to  their Armor Class equal to your Charisma modifier and advantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent">You may use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
