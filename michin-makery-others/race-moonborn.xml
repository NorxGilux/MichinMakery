    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Beings descended from lunar celestials.</p>
      <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <p>At a glance, moonborn look much like elves in their height, stature and builds. However, they have differences that tell them to worlds apart. For one thing, a moonborn's eyes will always be white. Their iris and pupils are pale to resemble the disk of a full moon. When the moon phases change, this is reflected in their eyes. Additionally, crescent horns made of moonstone sprout from the backs of their skulls and curve towards their forehead from behind. Moonborn are also usually painted with gold or pale inks that depict lunar motifs on their skin. Their hair can be a variety of colors, from grey to silver, or pale green and even purple. There are two types of moonborn: one is of the shard descent, who have dark tones of skin like that of the night; the other is of sliver descent, and they have pale skin that is almost silvery white.</p>
      <h4>HISTORY</h4>
      <p>The moonborn are said to be created from Selune after her grievous injuries from her battles against Shar, mistress of the night. As the world of Abeir-Toril flourished under Chauntea's watch, Selune saw the forces of Shar creep yet still into the Realmspace. To better protect life and light, the moon goddess gathered volunteers among her shards and slivers, celestial servants to the moon, and sent them down to the earthly realm with a new form. These are the moonborn. They were tasked with the jobs of watchmen and watchwomen over the vulnerable life of the new world in the harrowing nights when Selune's power waned. With the will of their goddess, they strike down evil creatures of the night like mad lycanthropes. Their numbers have persisted due to their mating with humans and elves, but as the night's powers grow ever stronger, the moonborn remain vigilant at the threat of being snuffed out themselves.</p>
      <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
      <p>Moonborn originally came in platoons loosely organized as units for battle. As their blood came to be scattered across the land, many now live in other societies, with their own families, though they never forget their duties. A large community of moonborn is known to reside in Waterdeep, where the House of the Moon temple stands. They are among the most fervent worshippers of Mystra and Selune. During the Time of Troubles, they were among the few who did not believe in Shar's trickery. But they had been overruled in opinion by the rest of the clergy. They thus harbor some inkling that perhaps not all life should be protected on this world, particularly that which is so easily manipulated by the likes of trickery like Shar. Unlike their celestial origin, they are susceptible to pulls of the more evil alignment.</p>
      <h4>APELING NAMES</h4>
