Your patron may have granted you your powers through a normal pact, imbuing you with its power, or it may have directly possessed you, using your body as a tool for whatever purposes it deems worthy.</p>

      <p>By 6th level, you can temporarily phase parts of yourself out of the physical world, like your patron. As a bonus action, you can become ethereal until the end of your current turn. While ethereal, the following rules apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can move through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain.</li>
        <li>If you end your turn inside an object, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, and take force damage equal to twice the amount of feet you were moved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once) and regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.</p>

      <p>At 14th level, you can fully change into a spectral form, taking over the body of a creature. As an action, you can cast dominate monster at 8th level without a spell slot on a creature within 5 feet of yourself, with the following changes for the duration of the spell:</p>

        <li>You cannot cast any spells.</li>

        <li>You can only experience what the target sees and hears, and can communicate with the host telepathically.</li>
        <li>You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass off as the creature you are possessing.</li>
        <li>If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends.</li>
        <li>If the target is targeted with a dispel evil and good spell or similar effect that would end possession, you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against the caster's spell save DC, or the spell ends.</li>
