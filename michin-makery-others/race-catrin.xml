      <p class="flavor">Creatures between life and death.</p>
      <p>In the old world, it is said that the Xibalbians never die, they just go to rest. The Catrines are a proof of this. They are the cold bodies of the dead that have been brought back to life, either by horrible magic, by fate or by the will of the Old Gods.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Catrines are very different from the rest of the undead and it would be an offense to compare them to a mere chattering skeletons. They are creatures of will, which is why they convince themselves that they are still alive and this is why they can be found enjoying worldly pleasures like smoking and getting drunk, even though their lungs and stomach no longer function.</p>
      <h4>Will of the Bones</h4>
      <p>These creatures have the form (skeletal or not) of the race to which they belonged in life. If their will is weak they simply turn to dust and die definitively, it is for this reason the catrines participate in parties banquets and any celebration they can find. To feel alive, many of them paint flowers on their faces and dress bizarrely to attract attention.</p>
      <p class="indent">However, their spectral nature makes them clearly different from the rest of mortals and the people of this world despise or fear them. That is why they live in a constant contradiction between showing themselves as they really are or hiding in the shadows.</p>
      <h4>Terrifying Appearance</h4>
      <p>The appearance of the catrines is usually terrifying. After all, there are not many people who like to be near the undead, and their species is extremely rare, magic scholars estimate that there is one catrín for every ten thousand mortals.</p>
      <h4>Catrín Names</h4>
      <p>Many times the catrines decide to keep their old name as a manifest of their second chance in life, other times they decide to adopt a new one, some examples of these are:</p>
      <p>
        <span class="feature">Male Names:</span>Albino, Ahagado, Geist, Huesos, Lázaro, Misterio, Quebranta, Zatanás<br />
