      <p>
        Infused with the rawest form of magical energy a little creature running around on a battlefield full of spellcasters. The little creature is collecting tiny glowing marbles which radiant a tiny magical aura from within. Sometimes a marble disappears in a floating book close. Others drop to the ground near some of the fighting people unleashing several bolts or other spells previously casted by them.
      </p>
      <h4>Collector of Arcane Knowledge </h4>
      <p>A Spellbinder got the never-ending quest to collect all knowledge corresponding to the arcane energies in the whole multiverse. Spellbinder are not born or trained like others; they are evolved into. Spellcasters who want to get the complete enlightenment about their magic and their potential might became a Spellbinder. But more often those seekers end up dead before their transformation. Spellbinder are able to remember their previous life and what they’ve learned but many things they need to relearn like using magic due to their new but deeper connection to it.</p>
      <h4>Creating A Spellbinder</h4>
      <p>When deciding to play a Spellbinder, think about what led your character to do the tasks of a Spellbinder. Maybe collecting arcane knowledge is a tradition in the area, or your character was supposed to be a researcher. What is your relationship with magic and spells in general? Is there a measure of arcane power? </p>

    <description>
      <p>As a being so close to the arcane energies of the world and your intuitive knowledge of the magic itself allows you to cast some spells. A Spellbinder doesn’t learn spells the usual way like a Wizard or Sorcerer. They must use their Binding Book or Spell Binding ability to learn new spells.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Cantrips</h5>
      <p>You know 3 cantrips of your choice from any spell list. You don’t learn additional Spellbinder cantrips at higher levels as usual.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spell Slots</h5>
      <p>The Spellbinder table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and above. To cast one of your Spellbinder spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from any spell list. You don’t learn additional Spells on reaching a higher level. You also can’t replace your spells as usual.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Spellbinder spells since you are a collector of arcane knowledge. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spellbinder spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <center>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
        </p>
      </center>
      <h5 class="caption">Ritual Casting</h5>
      <p>You can cast any Spellbinder spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. While doing that you don’t expend a spell slot. Out of combat, you also don’t add the 10 minutes to the casting time.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
      <p>
        You can’t use any kind focus as a spellcasting focus for your Spellbinder spells except of your <em>Binding Book.</em>

To create such marbles, you must make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus against a DC of 10 + the base spell level casted, not the level which the spell is casted on. For cantrips the DC is 10. You can use a marble to cast the spell or cantrip within it by using your own spell slots. While doing it the marble is consumed.</p>
