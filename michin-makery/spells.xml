      <p>You create a tiny glowing star in your hand. Until the spell ends, the star sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is colored silver. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can place a star on any surface to make this effect stationary.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can decide to throw the star as a ranged spell attack after casting this spell or as an action afterwards. Doing that the star shatters dealing 1d6 radiant damage.</p>
      <p class="indent">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>
      <p class="indent">The spell creates more than one star when you reach higher levels: two stars at 5th level, three stars at 11th level, and four stars at 17th level. you can direct the stars at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each star.</p>

      <p>A shining figure glowing with moonlight appears at your shoulder, and reaches out to a creature within range. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw.

      <p>A dark figure emitting shadows appears at your shoulder, and reaches out to a creature within range. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, the grasp cleaves into their soul, inflicting 10d6 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 30 hit points or fewer, they are instantly slain. If they succeed they receive half damage and do not get executed. Once the attack is made, the figure vanishes. If the target has a natural 20 on its saving throw, it receives no damage. On a natural 1 instead, the damage is doubled.</p>

      <p>A wave of darkness washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or takes negrotic or force damage (your choice) damage equal to 4d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier and has disadvantage on it's next attack. On a successful save, a creature takes only half the damage. This spell has no effect on constructs.</p>

        You summon a massive amount of darkness that surrounds you, covering your body and infusing you with necrotic strength. Whenever a creature within 120 feet hits you with an attack or spell a spark of darkness attempts to strike back. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 5d6 negrotic or force damage (your choice) damage on a failed save. While <em>Caligo Vengeance</em> is active you have advantage on attack rolls and spell attack rolls that deal necrotic damage.

        You call out to the dark Night and infuse some creatures with magical darkness. Choose a number of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier and transform them in guardians of the dark Night. The transformation lasts until the spell ends. The creatures eyes begin to darken, and their hair appears as if made from black water, and gain the following benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Magical darkvision with a range of 120 feet.</li>
        <li>50 temporary hit points.</li>
        <li>Advantage on any saving throw.</li>
        <li>Weapon attacks are considered magical and deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.</li>
        <li>Spectral wings appear on their back, giving them a flying speed of 40 feet.</li>
        <li>They have a +3 bonus to AC.</li>

        You conjure a swarm of sprectral crows which are hungry for blood and flesh. Choose a point within range, each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d4 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to re-cast this spell to let the crows strike again without expending a spell slot.
