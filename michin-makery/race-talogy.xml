    <p class="flavor">Still a Tabaxi with some shiny improvements, inspired by the Foreclaimers</p>
    <p>The Talogy are a vastly unknown race which originated from the common Tabaxi species. Some of these individuals were born as Tabaxi and later in life forged into a Talogy. Often the result of tragic accidents and unfortunate circumstances, some individuals of these newly formed species try to create a new society of their own. Exceedingly improved Tabaxi, with highly creative and technically skilled Artificern among them while socially similar to their mostly tribal societies made up of large familial units.</p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Inheriting the nature of the tabaxi they are ultimate travelers and rarely stay in one place for long. Intensely driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost. They have even been found wondering the stars, the Steel Plains of Mirrodin and savanna of Dominaria. They are also fearsome warriors, having halted the dragons on their conquest of the lands and tracking down their lairs like a swarm of ants taking down a beetle.</p>
    <h4>Physical Description</h4>
    <p>Like their less improved brothers and sisters, the Talogy are varied people in both attitude and appearance. In some lands, Talogy live like the cats they resemble, naturally curious and at home in playful environments. In other places, Talogy live as other folk do, not exhibiting the feline behavior the Cat Lord intended. The appearances of the Talogy are as varied as their attitudes. Some Talogy have features or patterning in their fur like tigers, jaguars, or other big cats, while others have appearances more like a house cat. The same variety is seen with their mechanical parts. Some Talogy are mostly Tabaxi, with just a few mechanical Prostheses like arms or legs, other individuals are almost not recognizable as catfolk anymore.</p>
    <h4>Talogy Traits</h4>
    <p>Forge-improved Tabaxi.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Increase one score by 2, or you increase two different scores by 1.<br />
      <span class="feature">Age.</span>Due to the variety of the Mechanical parts age is vastly different between individuals. From 65-80 but up to over 900 Years are possible. They mature normally at the age of 16.<br />
      <span class="feature">Size.</span>Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race. 4'11" to 6'8" tall, with a muscular but slim physique.<br />
      <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking and climbing speed is 30 feet.<br />
      <span class="feature">Darkvision.</span>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.<br />
      <span class="feature">Cat's Claws.</span>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength (or Dexterity) modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br />
      <span class="feature">Feline Agility.</span>Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you stand still (move 0 feet) on one of your turns.<br />
      <span class="feature">Powered.</span>A Talogy's power crystal can be removed at will and when it is removed from its socket, they lose all racial bonuses as well as any innate ability to cast spells. After a day, the mechanical parts will slowly disfunction until only basic functions are left. They will slowly begin to degrade over 100 Years, eventually reducing their lifespan by half.<br />
      <span class="feature">Solar Powered.</span>When powered, you do not need to sleep normally nor can you be put to sleep from magical effects.<br />
      <span class="feature">Solar Cat's Claws.</span>When Powered your unarmed strikes, deal an additional 1d4 force damage.<br />
      <span class="feature">Subrace.</span>Adult Talogy may choose to accept a type of body augmentation and subsequently be classified as a subrace. Choosing a body augmentation requires creating a new power crystal, which allows for only one augmentation at a time. The removal and insertion of a new crystal takes a toll on the Talogy's body and requires a long rest for the effects of the new crystal to take place.<br />
      <span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read and write in Common, Tabaxi and Payit.<br />
