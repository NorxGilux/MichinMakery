      <p>The Moon is the most powerful beeing of the night sky. Some nights spending light. Some nights leave everyone in darkness. Many people envy the moon for the beautiful light shining from. A light not pure but also not tainted. Any magical creature can feel the magic of that light - especially warlocks. But only a few knew the truth.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Lunar Queen actually is the one who sheds the magic coming from the moon, also gift some spellcaster a potion of her own power. But nobody should play with her kindness or harm her followers. It could not end well.</p>
