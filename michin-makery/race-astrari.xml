      <p class="flavor">Descendants of Night and Moon.</p>
      <p>A little soul drifting thru the night. The sky full of stars, not a single cloud but also no moon. The path splits. A path of light and a path of darkness. On both paths standing a beautiful feminine silhouette waiting for the soul to decide, promising to give it a new life and new powers. Deciding for one has no return to the other.</p>
      <h4>Physical Description</h4>
      <p>An Astrari looks like an elvish human with the beauty of a feminine Drow. They are considered one of the most beautiful beings known. They have pale skin and mostly a gracile body type. Just by looking, an uninformed one can not say if an Astrari is biologically male or female. They are all quite feminine and similar beautiful.</p>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>Astrari first appeared before the War of Light and Darkness as they were created as stars. At the end of that war some may have gotten into a very unstable state of being and vanish.</p>
      <p class="indent">Later when Toril got populated some Astrari found themselves in humanoid bodies, not remembering where there came from. Other humanoids, mostly elves and humans, got infused before their birth by the Moonmaiden or the Lady of Loss, becoming a humanoid Astrari. There are also stories of souls brought back to life as an Astrari by one of the Sisters.</p>
      <h4>Society</h4>
      <p>Astrari can live in any society but have unique abilities which differ from the usual people. Some may like them, some don't. Due to their heritage Astrari are usually admired by other elvenkind and other creatures who know about their connection to the Sisters-Who-Were-One.</p>
      <h4>Personality</h4>
      <p>Astrari know that they are beautiful and get what the want with ease. They mostly do want they want and love to trick somebody. Their most favourite season is the autumn, secondly the winter but never the spring and summer except for the clear night skies.</p>
      <h4>Astrari Names</h4>
      <p>Born Astrari usually have names like elves or humans. Reborn ones may keep their previous name.</p>
