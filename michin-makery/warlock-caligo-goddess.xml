      <p>The Dark is the most present beeing of the night. Some nights spending light. Some nights leave everyone in darkness. Many people envy the dark for the mysteries laid within. A darkness tainted by the loss of several. Any magical creature can feel the magic of that darkness - especially warlocks. But only a few knew the truth.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Caligo Queen actually is the one who darkens the night everytime, also gift some spellcaster a potion of her own power. But nobody should play with her highness or harm her followers. It could not end well.</p>
