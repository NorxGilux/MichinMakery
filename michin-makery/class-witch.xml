      <h4>Bound to freedom, nature and egoism</h4>
      <p>Every magic-using creature has it's own ways to approach the magic of the multiverse. Casting spells may be one of the most common using to access magic. Next to this, a Witch has their own little spells known as Hexes. They even may brew some potions or craft a little Charm with positive or negative effects to it's owner. If good or bad is just a matter of perspektive. However, for a Witch it mighty always be good since they only do what they want. And what the want is to live for their freedom and their own entertainment. Sure a witch may accompany others or agree to job offerings, but always out of own personal profit. Rarely to actually help.</p>
      <h4>Trap by a Hag</h4>
      <p>Speaking of Charms and Hexes. Never try to enter a cave or other housing of a witch if you are not prepared to have a massive headache, a missing finger or even worse afterwards. Maybe you'll loose some blood just because of a thirsty Hag which wants to taste your blood.</p>
      <h4>Creating a Witch</h4>
      <p>When deciding to play a Witch, think about what kind of Witch your character is and where they lives. Your Witch could be a casual old Hag living in a small hut somewhere in the swamps. Or, your Witch is a mistress, a beautiful lady living in the city next to some boring mudbloods. And yes, your witch can be of any gender you like or even a construct, since beeing a Witch is all about living your freedom.</p>
      <p class="indent">How did your character come to be an adventurer? Maybe you need to travel around to collect all the knowledge spread around the multiverse or you are just hungry for power.</p>
      <h5>Quick Build</h5>
      <p>
        You can make a Witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution and Wisdom. Second, select the <em>Noble</em> or <em>Hermit</em> background. Third, select the <em>Fire Bolt</em>, <em>Shocking Grasp</em> and <em>Ray of Frost</em> or <em>Light</em> cantrips. Fourth, select the <em>Burning Hands</em>, <em>Thunderwave</em> and <em>Mage Armor</em> spells.

      <p>It is possible for you to slighty weave the fine lines of magic all around us. From birth or by a contract to a greater beeing you got the ability to use magic.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Cantrips</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Witch spell list. You learn additional Witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spell Slots</h5>
      <p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Witch spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Witch spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
      <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Witch spell list.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more Witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
      <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to bend the magic to your will. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <center>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
        </p>

      <h5 class="caption">Ritual Casting</h5>
      <p>You can cast any Witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. While doing that you don’t expend a spell slot.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, you gain three Witchcrafts. When you gain certain Witch levels, you gain additional Witchcrafts of your choice, as shown in the Witchcrafts Known column of the Witch table. You can craft Charms, brew Potions or cast Hexes.</p>
      <p class="intend">Charms are little trinkets you can craft from wood and other common materials. They grant certain effects to it's wearer for a limited time. It takes 10 minutes to craft a Charm and their magic last for one hour. Charms increase the affected attribute by half of your proficiency bonus rounded down if not written otherwise within the description of the charm.</p>
      <p class="intend">Hexes are like spells but do not count against the number of spells known. Hexes are treated like curses or buffs and take a bonus action to cast. The effect and duration of a Hex varies and is written in the corresponding Witchcraft. If you cast a Hex the target may succeed on a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid the hex. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of it's turn to end the hex.</p>
      <p class="intend">You are also able to brew potions if you have the required tools. Each potion needs water as a base and several other ingredients. In suitable areas you can try to collect those ingredients. Those areas may be caves, woods and coasts. As every potion needs different ingredients, determine with your DM if you can collect the needed ingredients in your current area. Otherwise you can buy the ingredients for three quarters of the price which the potion would usually costs. The time needed to collect ingredients and brew the potion is written in the corresponding Witchcraft. You are able to combine several potion's effects into one potion. If you do so you have to provide the same materials as if you brew each potion on it's own. The time spend to brew that combined potion is determined by the potion which would take the longest. If you obtain potion formulas during your adventures in other ways than by Witchcrafts and you picked the Potion Crafting Witchcraft, you can handle them as Witchcraft Potions and the don't count against the number of Witchcrafts known.</p>
      <p class="intend">Crafting a Charm or casting a Hex requires one usage of the Witchcraft feature. Brewing a potion doesn't. You can use this feature up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, they can't be used.</li>
        <li>When your familiar transforms, ir assumes the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When it reverts to it's normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. However, if your familiar reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to it's normal form.
